# 3D Level Design 

3D Level Design module taught unsurprisingly basic 3D level design concepts and game engine fundamentals. Students had the opportunity to develop a 3D level in a popular engine such as Unreal 4 and Unity along with a design report and user testing. Students were given complete creative freedom with regards to the level and was seen as a great opportunity for students to develop a portfolio piece.

## Assignment
 
The assignment was in two parts. The first was to create a document setting out the design and theme of the level. This report was meant to reference valid game design research to validate design decisions. It also set out how the level was to be implemented. The second part of the assessment was the creation of the 3D level with user testing. This formed the majority of the marks and it was were most of my time was spent.

## Submission

An expansive level design document was submitted setting out the technology and basic game concepts in great detail with valid references. I built the level with the Unity game engine as it was one I had used previously. The 3D level comprised of advanced features such as animated models, custom 3D terrain, particle effects and immersive audio.
